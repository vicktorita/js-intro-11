Reference Types: 
Arrays: are used to store multiple same/similar data
Objects: are used to store key-value pairs (properties)

Arrays: 







*** constructor in all programming languages 
Used to instantiate an object from a blueprint/templates/prototypes

const arr = new Array();

arr is the instance of the Array prototype
Array is the blueprint/prototype 
Array() is the constructor of the Array prototype 
We use constructors with new keyword


*** Interview Questions : mutable vs immutable
String: immutable (original value cannot be changed)
Array: mutable (original value can be changed)

Primitives are immutable
References are mutable



unshift: add elements to the head of the array - longer array 
shift: removes elements from the head of the array - shorter array
