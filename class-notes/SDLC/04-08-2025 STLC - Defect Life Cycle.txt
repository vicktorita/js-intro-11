STLC: Software Testing Life Cycle


Let's say, we're in sprint-26 this week.

Refinement meetings to discuss the PBIs for future sprints (27-28-29-30).
We discuss the requirements/acceptance criterias.


1. Read and understand requirements
2. Planning: what kind of tests this PBIs requires
3. Write test cases
4. Environment set up or make sure developers merge their changes in test environment
5. Execution: 
	-Run your test cases manually
	-Report unexpected issues (defect/bug tickets)
	-Write scripts - automation (playwright-js or cypress-js, playwright-ts)
6. Closure: Reports/Documentation

CREATE BUG TICKET:

What do you include in a bug ticket?
Description: high-level summary of the issue you found

Details:
	Environment: most of the time Test/QA/IT or Dev/STG/UAT or PROD

	Steps to reproduce:
	Expected and Actual result:

	Attachments: screenshots, video
	Logs from Database or Developer tools


Bug Life Cycle?
1. New - Opened
2. Assigned -  to a dev
3. In progress 
4. Dev done
5. Retest
6. if passed -> fixed -> closed
	if not -> 
	7. Reassigned - to a dev
	8. follow the same steps until it is fixed and passed.



Severity: how impactful the bug is considered the application.
Priority: how soon the plan is to fic the bug

Discuss Bugs for different states:
High-Medium-Low
Critical-Major-Minor-Cosmetic



RTM: Requirement Traceability Matrix
Used to make sure each acceptance criteria is covered by at leas one test case
