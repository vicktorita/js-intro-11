Statements: every single line of code 
-Each statement ends with a ;

Comments: Explain your code
// single line comments

""""    this is not allowed 

'""'    this is allowed 
"''"    this is allowed







String data - values 
-They are always stored in single or double quotes
'John'
"James"


Number data - values
-They should not be stored with quotes 

let number = 5;
let num = '5'; 

number + 2 -> 7
num + 2    -> '52'

Concatenation
'5' + '5'   -> '55'
3 + '5'     -> '35'
'2' + 2     -> '22'


Addition
5 + 5       -> 10


Tricky part:
3 + 3 + '5'   -> '65'

'2' + 1 + 1 + 1   -> '2111'


'7' + (5 + 2)     -> '77'


OOO
1. Exponentiation
2. Parantheses
3. Multiplication/Division 
4. Addition/Subtraction


undefined data type:
default type when you declare a variable without assigning a value

let address; // undefined


1. Initialization
let name = 'John';
let age = 45;

2. Declaring a variable 
let name;
let age;

3. Assignment or re-assignment 
name = 'John';
age = 45;


let and const are ES6 features (added in 2015)


RULES: syntax rules you MUST follow (Error)
Conventions: Good to follow - unwritten rules 


let age;                  true                   
let AGE;                  true but not preferred
let shift$;               true
let number of students;   false
let _firstLetter;         true 
let 8students;            false
let isWeatherSnowing#;    false 
let @balance;             false

= is the assignment operator 

let city = 'Chicago';



const name, age;          false
let n1 = 45, n2;          true
const num1 = 45, num2;    false
let x, let y;             false
let a; let b;             true but not preferred
let i1; i2;               seems to be true (compiler) but throws error when executed
