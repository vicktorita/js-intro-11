ES6 - ES2015 

Before ES6: JS was commonly used for web development (frontend).


Frontend: UI (User Interface) of the application -> developed using JS 
API: Application Programming Interface (REST, SOAP, GRAPHQL)
Backend: Server and DB

Backend Developers: Java, .NET/C#, Ruby, GO, JS

After ES6: JS can be used for backend development as well.


ES6: Interviews Questions:
Tell me some new features added with ES6?
-> let-const
-> for...of loop
-> arrow functions
-> string templates / interpolation
-> spread operator
-> default parameters
-> rest parameters 
-> classes
-> promises (async - await)
-> Map, Set


Can you tell me how many different ways you can create functions in JS?
1. function declaration
2. function expression
3. arrow function
4. constructor function
5. IIFE 
6. Recursive functions


Recursion: it is a concept that a function invokes itself within its body
// There is an infinite loop for below execution
function printHi() {
  printHi();
}

printHi();


What is the difference between spread operator and the rest parameters?
const arr = [1, 3, 4];

...arr -> this will spread array elements into individual values


function funcName(...rest) { // ...rest will collect individual arguments in an array
  [1, 2, 3]
}

funcName(1, 2, 3)


Vanilla JS = pure JS
