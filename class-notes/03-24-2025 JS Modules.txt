JS Modules

Creating small-reusable, easy to maintain components (functions, objects, classes)
to be exported and reused anywhere in your project by importing.

Or, sometimes we install some ready packages (NPM) and these are stored in node_modules
and we can import them to use anywhere within our project.


There is 2 ways to create/use JS Modules 
1. CommonJS: mostly used with NodeJS 
2. ES6 Modules: mostly used with browsers
