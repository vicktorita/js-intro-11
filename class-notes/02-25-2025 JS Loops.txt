1. FOR LOOP 
-also known as i loop or traditional loop
-it uses 3 expression 
  -initialization: it is the start point for the loop 
  -condition: it is the termination point (stop)
  -update: the change for each iteration 

SYNTAX:
for(initialization; condition; update) {
  // block of code to execute
}

Infinite Loop: it is an error with the loop makes it infinite and never stops.
Be careful with your loop logic and make sure it is not infinite

DO NOT USE BELOW FOR CHECKING IF A NUMBER IS ODD!!!
i % 2 === 1

USE:
i % 2 !== 0
