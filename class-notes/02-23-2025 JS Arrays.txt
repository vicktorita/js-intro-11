SORTING ARRAYS:

ASCENDING ORDER: smallest -> largest 
DESCENDING ORDER: largest -> smallest

// [ 1, 40, 15, 20, 2]
numbers.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a - b
});

a     b       a - b       result    memory 
1     40      1-40        negative  1 should be listed earlier than 40 
40    15      40-15       positive  40 should be listed later than 15
