JavaScript is single-threaded.
JS will execute the code line-by-line.
JS can execute one task at a time. 

Multi-threaded languages: C++, Java


JavaScript is asynchronous by default.


Call Stack: works with the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
Event loop: In the case of asynchronous programs, it will help JS to 
wait for delayed operations


Mutability
Mutable: changing (references)
Immutable: not changing (primitives)

Shallow copy: is when you use spread operator to create a copy of a JS object (reference types)
Spread operator will not be ideal when object is nested
Deep copy: is when you use JSON parse and stringify methods to create a copy of a JS object
This will completely create an independent copy which will not affect the original object
