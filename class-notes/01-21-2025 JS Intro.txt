Programming Language:
JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, C++, Python, Swift, PHP, Perl, Ruby


Code  - source code: written in a programming language

Syntax: This is grammar rules for learning a programming language

const name = 'John';
name = 'James'; // complain - compile error - syntax error - compilation issue




Execute - execution - run the code
Compile - compilation - compiler - make sure the code does not have syntax error

ES6 - ES2015 Biggest and nicest release for JS

EcmaScript = JavaScript


Cypress (JS) + Playwright (JS, TS, Java, C#, Python)


TypeScript is just superset of JavaScript
TypeScript is compiled version of JavaScript
Type-safety



Compiled languages: TypeScript, Java, C# (syntax heavy - strict rules)
statically-typed

Interpreted languages: JavaScript (more flexible syntax)
dynamically-typed

Ways to run JS code
1. Use node.js
2. Use browser
3. CodeRunner Extension (not recommended for work but for learning)
