GIT: software used to track files/versions and collaborate with others.
GitHub: Hosting website (repository)

Git is distributed VCS (Version Control System)
distributed vs centralized

Bitbucket, GitLab, Azure DevOps

2 different flows 
local master branch -> we did changes -> stage/commit/push -> remote master 

LOCAL: Our laptops, machines 
REMOTE: Cloud 


local master branch -> local task branch -> we did changes -> stage/commit/push
-> remote task branch -> PR or MR -> Reviewers / Approvals -> remote master branch



Cloning remote repositories to your local 
1. You'll be provided repository url
2. Copy the cloning address 
3. Open your terminal/cmd and run below code in the correct path
  git clone <repo-url>



Merge Conflict: 
It happens when 2 or more collaborators contribute to same file.

1. Resolve inline in GitHub

2. Resolve in VSCode 
  Go to VSCode 
  Switch to Master 
  Pull the changes into local master from remote master (git pull)
  Switch back to your local branch which caused conflict 
  Merge local master into your local branch (git merge master)

You should see same conflicts in VSCode now! 
Resolve them and commit your changes one more time.
